# Grotto Skills

Public skill repository for The Grotto developer ecosystem.

This repo is intentionally simple: each skill lives under `skills/<skill-name>/` with a `SKILL.md` entry point plus optional `templates/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.

## Included skills

### Grotto Game Runtime Developer SDK

Path: `skills/grotto-game-runtime-developer-sdk/SKILL.md`

Use this skill when building Grotto-hosted HTML5 or WebGL games that need:

- trusted Grotto player identity
- cloud saves and autosave
- save slots and conflict-safe sync
- leaderboards and gameplay events
- presence and future multiplayer hooks
- Railway or Supabase-backed custom game services

### Grotto Game Token-Gated Inventory

Path: `skills/grotto-game-token-gated-inventory/SKILL.md`

Use this skill when a Grotto game needs NFT/ERC1155/ERC721 ownership checks, associated wallet inventory lookup, token-gated skins, game-pass unlocks, asset unlocks, or server-authoritative entitlements.

### Grotto Hosted Game GitHub Workflow

Path: `skills/grotto-hosted-game-github-workflow/SKILL.md`

Use this skill when a Grotto game should be maintained through GitHub PRs, CI tests, hosted Railway/Vercel clients, and a small Grotto iframe wrapper for quick updates and rollback.

### Grotto Studio Game Updates

Path: `skills/grotto-studio-game-updates/SKILL.md`

Use this skill to explain to a creator how to update a game in Grotto Studio so the new version reaches players instantly — iterating with B.O.B., keeping cloud saves intact across updates, and rolling back a bad change.

## Contributing

Open a pull request to add or update a skill. Keep skills creator-facing, practical, and free of private credentials.

### Safety rules

- Do not commit API keys, bearer tokens, Privy secrets, Railway/Vercel tokens, `gst_*`, or `grs_*` values.
- Redact secrets as `[REDACTED]`.
- Prefer runnable examples and explicit security notes.
- Keep Grotto identity/session guidance clear: games should not trust wallet/user IDs supplied by client-side code.

## PR watch

This repo is watched for pull requests by Bob/Hermes so skill contributions can be triaged quickly.
